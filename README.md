## [/SPLITREADER](/SPLITREADER) 

This public repository contains the scripts for running the SPLITREADER pipeline initially developped by [Quadrana et al. eLife 2016](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15716) and further improved by [Baduel et al. MMB 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-1134-0_15). 

### [/SPLITREADER/SPLITREADER_V1.0](/SPLITREADER_V1.0)

This folder contains the scripts to detect non-reference transposable element insertions from short-read sequencing data as described in [Baduel et al. MMB 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-1134-0_15). <br/>
Accessory files and wrapper scripts are also available in [/thaliana](/SPLITREADER/thaliana) to run the SPLITREADER pipeline on the _A. thaliana_ genome. <br/>

### [/SPLITREADER/SPLITREADER_V1.2](/SPLITREADER_V1.2)

This folder contains a snakemake version of the SPLITREADER pipeline produced by [@aurelpetit](https://github.com/aurelpetit) for enhanced portability and ease of use.
