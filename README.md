## SPLITREADER pipeline and accessory scripts and file for _A. thaliana_: [/SPLITREADER](/SPLITREADER)
Scripts to detect non-reference transposable element insertions from short-read sequencing data as described in Baduel et al. MMB 2021. <br/>
Accessory files and wrapper scripts are available in [/thaliana](/SPLITREADER/thaliana) to run the SPLITREADER pipeline on the _A. thaliana_ genome. <br/>
